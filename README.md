# Cake Eating II: Introduction to Optimal Saving (Numerical)

This is Quantecon Lecture 44: Intro to Optimal Savings 2

## Overview

In this lecture we continue the study of [the cake eating problem](https://python.quantecon.org/cake_eating_problem.html). The aim of this lecture is to solve the problem using numerical methods. At first this might appear unnecessary, since we already obtained the optimal policy analytically.

However, the cake eating problem is too simple to be useful without modifications, and once we start modifying the problem, numerical methods become essential. Hence it makes sense to introduce numerical methods now, and test them on this simple problem. Since we know the analytical solution, this will allow us to assess the accuracy of alternative numerical methods.
